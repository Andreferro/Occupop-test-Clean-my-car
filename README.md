# Occupop Test - Clean my car

### Frameworks and main dependencies:
- React
- Typescript
- Vite
- Yarn
- Semantic UI
- React Router

### Running the application:
``` shell
# First, install the dependencies
$ yarn install

# Run the application
$ yarn dev

# Build the application. This will create files at /dist folder
$ yarn build
```

### Notes:
- Used [BEM](https://getbem.com/) methodology to write custom CSS
- Why using Vite instead of Webpack?
  > Vite provides an easier and fater setup. It requires less configuration that Webpack and has a faster build.
